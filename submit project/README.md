## Architecture Explanation
This is a placeholder section where you can provide an explanation and reasoning for your architecture selection for both the Azure Web App and Azure Function.
    ### Answer: After migrate the application web app to an Azure App Service and update the notification logic code using service bus queue messgae. I see
        - With Web App:
            I used the Basic tier with autoscaling becuase app service provides a managed environment with easy scaling options. The basic tier offers a good balance between cost and performance.

                        App Service plan: ASP-rgproj3-8d70
                        Operating System: Linux
                        SKU and size: Basic (B1)
        - With Azure Function:
            I deployed the Azure Function using the Consumption Plan because the Consumption Plan charges only for per-second resource consumption and executions. Itâ€™s ideal for functions that are triggered infrequently, making it highly cost-effective.
